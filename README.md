# JPyNotes

This is library for interacting with IBM Lotus Notes from the command line using jython.

It is easy to find information only no how to query IBM Lotus Notes using COM+ interface but that can only be used under Windows. Since I run Linux, I went for using java. I added the simplicity and versatility of Python and ended up using Jython. For this reason this is probably platform independent but I am only using this under Linux and never tested in any other platform.

I have to thank the guys from http://lngooglecalsync.sourceforge.net because their code has been a big help creating this.
